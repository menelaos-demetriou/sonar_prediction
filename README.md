# Sonar Prediction
The task is to train a predictor to discriminate between sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.

# To-do:
Add more models for grid search.  
Try bayesian optimisation for hyperparameter tuning instead of grid search.  
Add training and validation plots to examine bias-variance trade off.  

# Requirements
pandas  
numpy  
scikit-learn  
keras
